# Beacon Project

The Beacon project is a repository for the ecosystem of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http:ga4gh.org) (GA4GH) "Beacon" genomic data discovery & federation API. The Beacon project(s) is [supported by ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/beacon-landing-page), the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization, but involves many international collaborators.

Inside GA4GH the Beacon project is part of the [Discovery work stream](https://www.ga4gh.org/work_stream/discovery/).

The main website of the Beacon project can be found at [beacon-project.io](https://beacon-project.io). On [the Beacon v2 documentation site](http://docs.genomebeacons.org) you will find detailed information about the Beacon v2 API and its use.
